# HytaleModding Patcher

This tool allows you to more easily prepare an environment for exploring the Hytale Server without publishing the decompiled code.

# Why?

When you add a compiled jar as a library, IntelliJ only decompiles class by class and doesn't let you search it. For example, you cannot right click some class and then Find Usages. This script will give you a ready to use Hytale server code as a project where you can explore anything you want.
